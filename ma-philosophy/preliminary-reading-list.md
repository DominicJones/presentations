Buckingham MA in Philosophy

Preliminary Reading List

I shall be trying to teach philosophy both as it is as an academic discipline and as it might be applied to the pressing questions of our day, which include all of these: human nature – what kind of thing are we? Morality – how should we live? Sex – is this a biological, a moral or a spiritual category, and what in any case is the difference? Religion – does it have intellectual foundations, and is it a blessing, a curse or neither? Politics – how mediate the rival conceptions of justice, nationhood, civil society and public duty? Art – is there a real definition available, and if not how do you distinguishing real art from fake art? And so on.

The preliminary reading will introduce some of those topics. I have tried to guide students through the history of modern philosophy in A Short History of Modern Philosophy Routledge, 2nd edn., 1995, and attempted an overview of the academic field as it was 20 years ago in Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey, now published by Penguin New York. 

Crucial to the first term’s work will be the following: 
P.F. Strawson, ‘Freedom and Resentment’ in the book of that title.
Nietzsche, The Genealogy of Morals.
Kant, The Foundations of the Metaphysic of Morals.
Plato, The Symposium.
Scruton, Phryne’s Symposium in Xanthippic Dialogues.
Thomas Nagel, Mortal Questions. 

In order to get some sense of where philosophy now is, it would be good to look at these:
Simon Critchley, Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction
Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations.
Simon Blackburn, Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy.
